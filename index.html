        <p>BIO<br>Grace didnt become a photographer by chance. For her picking up a camera was destiny.</p> 
        
        <p>Grace's earliest memories of picking up a camera was from when she was only 8 years old , she had been searching through her grandparents attic exploring all of the lost memories and treasures that had been tucked away and long forgotten. It wasnt untill she stumpled across a box of her grandfather old polaroids and film. Grace was amazed. She spent hours looking at every photo ,scaning over every detail. You see Grace's grandfather had passed away before she was born ,and yet looking at those photos made her feel like he was right there next to her. For her the photos were like little time machines that could teleport you to that very moment in time.</p>
        
        <p>In her hands she held a tiny peice of history. And it was wonderfull.</p> 
        
        <p>Grace ran downstairs with the poloroids in her hand and from there the rest is history. She would soon go on to graduate from Photographer University at the very top of her class.</p>

<p>"A camera is like a window to a person's soul, i think thats why i enjoy photographing people who are just going about with their everyday lives, whether they are at the grocery store or just going for a walk. Its so innocent. Its so true. Anyone can spend month planning an expensive photo shoot with the most fancy clothes and prettiest models they can find but no thats not life, thats pretend. 
The people i photograph ,are everyday people, these people have nothing to hide, they're just trying to make a living and go about life one day at a time. And i think that's beautiful</p>

<p>My dream job would be to tour the world and shoot for geographic magazine."</p>
